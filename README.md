# simple-circuitbreaker
simple and thread-safe circuitbreaker implementation without HALF-OPEN state based on Hystrix implementation


Hystrix dependecy is used just for Sliding/Rolling Window implementation and maybe it's little overhead to use the whole library from Netflix but this is just example :) When I find some time I will probably make my own Sliding Window implementation to keep simplicity.  


# Todo 

 * own implementation of sliding window algorithm
 * ~~unit tests~~
 * ~~extract interface for circuitbreaker and implement no op implementation~~
 * ~~get rid of hardcoded configuration :(~~

# Usage

```java
public class TestCase {

    private CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = new DefaultCircuitBreaker(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    private MailService mailService = new MailService();
 		
    public String doSomething(String destination, Mail mail) throws Exception {
        circuitBreaker.doCall((flag) -> mailService.sendMail(destination, mail));
    }
}

```
